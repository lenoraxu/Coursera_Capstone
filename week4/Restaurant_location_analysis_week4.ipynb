    "As a Chinese proverb goes, food is the first necessity of the people, food is the most basic conditions for survival.This shows the importance of eating to human beings. Three meals a day are indispensable. However, with the speeding pace of life and high intensity work under pressure in the modern society,  spending a lot of time and energy to cook at home has become a luxury. More and more people choose to eat out or increase the frequency of eating out. Especially in modern metropolises like New York City, restaurants are everywhere, opening and closing every day. But why some restaurants after opening can be filled with customers and make a lot of money, while others have slow bussiness. Location is one of the important factors."

    "2) There are 2155 population density data and 864 median household income data missed in a total of 2711 restaurant samples. Those data is too much to be ignored, so I give them the data by borough which is the mean of data by neighborhoods instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Some restaurant open another store in the same or diffrent neighborhood, this is an independant sample, but it may result in an error. So I combine the restaurant name with 'index',  give every restaurant a unique name. \n",
